# 💸 Every Dollar Budgeting Alpha (Python / Django) 💸
My take on a budgeting app, orginating from my present need to get my own finances in order. This web 
application is being built using Python 3.11, Django, and HTML in PyCharm on Windows 11. Includes data persistance and
authentication

# What is "aggressiveness"?
Allows the user to control how aggressively they want to save based on their goals. After taking out
money for the appropriate expenses, the aggressiveness factor chosen will determine how much of the 
remaining money will be saved and how much can be spent.
- Moderately = 70% saved 😄
- Aggressive = 80% saved 🔥
- Insane = 90% saved 🤑
- Everything = 100% saved ☠️

# Project Status
As of December 22, 2025, Every Dollar Budgeting has moved into its Alpha

# Project Background
This is my second official project using Django. My first was the Symbol Authentication application,
which focused on account creation and authentication. This project is me putting Django into real 
practice, and it’s getting easier by the day. Django is extremely useful, with many built-in features 
that make development smoother.<br><br>
I’ve also been learning more HTML. Earlier in my journey, I used HTML and CSS to build a 
personal website, but I dropped it to focus on Python. Now it’s come back naturally. It’s 
interesting that after using Tkinter, then PyQtWidgets, I’ve now upgraded to HTML, which feels 
like the ultimate UI. There is some CSS in this project, but my focus right now is functionality 
and core features rather than styling.<br><br>
I created this project because I need to get my budgeting down and be better with money. 
I wanted a way to exercise my coding skills while also improving my financial habits, so creating a
budgeting app that I would actually use made sense. This is the bigger project I’ve been leaning 
toward, and the precursor to it was the CADE Data Entry app.<br><br>
This project is the next step above that.
## 🧔‍♂️ Origin of the Name
The name Every Dollar comes from Dave Ramsey’s book The <i>Total Money Makeover</i>, where he emphasizes that every dollar should have a purpose. This application is built on that same idea: ensuring that every single dollar has a name and a destination.
